> ¿What is Dynamic Programming?

In the concept is a programming paradigm but in my learning across the DP, I think it's more a skill that We can implement in a any kind of paradigm, like POO or Functional to improve the performance of our code.

>Dynamic Programming Exercises Written in Javascript

Here I will be posting all Scripts that solves a certain problem using Dynamic Programming concepts.

Dynamic Programming is a method to optimize solutions for problems using a several techniques or splitting up the problem into subproblems.
Personally I think the theory for people to low level knowlegde in Maths are so hard.
But practicing in problems all can understand little by little this very high tool for any Developer, also will be you a better Software Egineer.

>¿Why Javascript?
Because is the language I most used today, but applies in any language is more about algorithms. I strongly recommended too use in languages that are very focused in Functional Programming like Haskell, Rust, etc. Also Kotlin is very focused in Poo and Functional.

In my excercies always I will try implement latest features of javascript like destructuring and so on...
